# Pytorch Trainer 

The Pytorch Trainer is a simple framework for training neural networks in Pytorch. It is designed to be simple to use and easy to extend. I am planning to use it for my own research projects, but I hope it will be useful for others as well.

## Installation

The Pytorch Trainer can be installed directly from github using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ChikkaUdayaSai/PytorchTrainer.git
```

## Usage
Just import the package and start using it.

## Structure
The Pytorch Trainer is designed to be simple to use and easy to extend. It is based on the following principles:

- **Modularity**: The Pytorch Trainer is designed to be modular. It is easy to add new modules and to customize or replace existing ones.
- **Simplicity**: The Pytorch Trainer is designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy to use.
- **Extensibility**: The Pytorch Trainer is designed to be extensible, both to new hardware and to new research ideas.

## Files and Folders
- **datasets**: This folder contains the code for loading and preprocessing datasets.
- **models**: This folder contains the code for the models.
- **utils**: This folder contains the code for the utilities.
- **main.py**: This file contains the code for training and testing the model.
