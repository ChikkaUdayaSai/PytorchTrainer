# Pytorch Trainer 

The Pytorch Trainer is a simple framework for training neural networks in Pytorch. It is designed to be simple to use and easy to extend. I am planning to use it for my own research projects, but I hope it will be useful for others as well.

## Installation

The Pytorch Trainer can be installed directly from github using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ChikkaUdayaSai/pytorch-trainer.git
```
